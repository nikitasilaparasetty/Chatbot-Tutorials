# Chatbot Tutorials

In this repository, we will go through different ways of creating chatbots with the help of Python and its libraries. We will start with a very basic chatbot for beginners, and slowly progress to more advanced versions. 
Have fun!

**Q. What are chatbots?**

A. Chatbots are designed to simulate human conversation by allowing a machine to converse with a person using natural human language. 

**Q. How are chatbots used?**

A. Chatbots can be interacted with either through spoken or written word (i.e., voice or text input). They use Artificial Intelligence to understand what a person is telling them, and then respond accordingly with some pre-defined output. 




## Program 1 - A Very Simple Chatbot

This chatbot uses NLTK and its utilites to understand and respond to some pre-defined inputs. 

It is great for beginners to understand how the NLTK library can be used to process our natural human language. The structure of this program is easy. You can complete it in less than 10 minutes.

## Program 2 - How to Build a Chatbot Using the Python ChatterBot Library

This chatbot uses ChatterBot and its utilities to develop conversational skills. 

It is a very simple yet powerful way to develop a chatbot by providing the program with training data and allowing it to continue learning and improving over time. You can complete it in less than 10 minutes.
